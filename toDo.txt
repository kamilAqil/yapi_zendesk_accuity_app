- on front end get organization data and pass to acuity route

- from acuity route we will need to initialize a zendesk client 
the zendesk-node-api gives you a method to search by ID hopefully 
this will have enough data about users in the organizations when 
searching the organization ID. 

-- notes for the curl 


curl https://yapi1504512150.zendesk.com/api/v2/organizations.json \
  -u kamil.aqil@yapicentral.com/token:SEDAk49Im98efpxtt950zWlyvYMgPc3zff7NtG3D


this works fine
